## Acknowledgments

A huge thank you to my teachers at Noroff for their continuous guidance, support, and feedback. I also acknowledge that I used ChatGPT to ask for clarifications whenever I got stuck. This helped me understand concepts and continue progressing, while ensuring I wrote and implemented the code myself.
